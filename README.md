# NYC-LocalGeo-CrossWalk
A single file that links up all the local geographies in New York City.

This is something that I've been meaning to do for a very long.

**What is this?**

A single csv file that *walks* across all of New York City's local geographies. This file links up the following geographies in a single tabulated file:

 - Borough Boundaries 
 - Census Blocks 2010 
 - Census Tracts 2010 
 - City Council Districts 
 - Community Districts 
 - Election Districts 
 - Fire Battalions 
 - Fire Companies 
 - Fire Divisions 
 - Health Area 
 - Health Center 
 - Municipal Court Districts 
 - Neighborhood Tabulation Areas
 - Police Precincts 
 - School Districts 
 - State Assembly Districts 
 - State Senate Districts 
 - U.S. Congressional Districts 

**Why do we need this?**

This dataset would help answer questions like:

    In New York City:
	    How many census Tracts are located in School District 31?
	    AND 
	    Which Fire District is serviced by this School District?
	    AND 
	    Which City Council District is in?
	    AND 
	    Which Congressional District is it in?

Here is a similar approach visualized for Census Data:
