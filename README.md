**Why do we need this?**

This dataset would help answer questions like:

    In New York City:
	    How many and which Census Tracts are located in School District 31?
	    AND 
	    Which Fire District is serviced by this School District?
	    AND 
	    Which City Council District is in?
	    AND 
	    Which Congressional District is it in?
